# ComeFlyWithMe

This gem scaffolds a Sinatra app with Haml, Sass, Compass, JQuery and Angular based on https://github.com/agilbert201/sinatra-scaffold. I have done this to learn about creating gems and creating a command line interface with Ruby. 

##Installation

Install the gem as:

    $ gem install come_fly_with_me

## Usage

In your command line, type:

	$ come_fly_with_me your_app_name

This will create the folder your_app_name, where you'll find a working Sinatra application with a 'Home' and 'About' page.
